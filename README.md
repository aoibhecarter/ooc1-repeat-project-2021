# ooc1-repeat-project-2021
A Java application that demonstrates the 4 Pillars of OOP (i.e., Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction)

This project manages all the objects in the makeup list (the topic I choose for this)
Also I know this is all added very late but this laptop is broken so it is very hard to do anything on it
